    By default the tests run against a mocked S3 client. To run these against
    the real Amazon S3 service or another object store, set fs.hboss.data.uri
    and any required credentials in auth-keys.xml. e.g.:

      <configuration>
        <property>
          <name>fs.hboss.data.uri</name>
          <value>s3a://.../</value>
        </property>

        <property>
          <name>fs.s3a.secret.key</name>
          <value>...</value>
        </property>

        <property>
          <name>fs.s3a.access.key</name>
          <value>...</value>
        </property>
      </configuration>

    S3Guard will also be configured to the LocalMetadataStore implementation
    by default. You may wish to configure DynamoDBMetadataStore for integration
    or if S3Guard is not needed (S3-compatible appliance, for instance), you
    can disable it by configuring NullMetadataStore explicitly (see below).
